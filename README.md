# Hear Me Out / Spotify Web API Project

Hello Twitch Team,

I set out to build "Hear Me Out" is a minimal, dark theme music player made with React and Express.js that lets you search and play sample songs using Spotify's Web API.

## A Warning

This app is unfinished, a bit DRY, not deployed, and currently being written by someone with 4 hours of sleep in the last 48 hours. I had an all-night battle with Heroku and lost. My app will not work locally or deployed so I do not have screenshots and due to that, I will simply go over the requirements I did meet and address the issues in the interview. 

Thank you so much for the opportunity and I am excited to explain this process to the team.


## The Requirements

You gave 6 of them. Let's see how I did:

1) Does this app use a modern JS Library/Framework?
   - Yes. 2 to be exact. React & Express.js Also, a mean language named TypeScript.

2) Create Create an application that can be interacted with, in a minimum of three different ways by the user. 
   - Play/Pause. Search. Login. "See all albums" toggle.

3) Integration with a 3rd Party RESTful API.
   - OAuth and music retrieval via Spotify Web API

4) Usage Of at least 5 UI components from the @material-UI/core library.

    - Box, Grid, Button, TextField, Icon (Play/Pause toggle)


5) Usage of the architectural pattern.
   - MVC was my chosen pattern. I kept my controller components and my views components separated.

6) An example of a reusable UI component.
   - I did not reach this goal. I designed the button but never implemented it.
